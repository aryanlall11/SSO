## Umm...So, what do I get?

- **EASY MANAGEMENT**

	Using SSO synchronises passwords and user information, which makes access to different platforms and resources easier.

- **SECURITY**

	This authentication system improves network and application security. SSO can uniquely identify a user, and it therefore complies with the most demanding safety standards. Also, information provided by SSO moves encrypted across the network.

- **EASE OF USE**

	SSO solutions improve the user experience by avoiding the interruptions caused by password requests to access their IT tools. The user is authenticated once and the system allows him to access the resources for which he/she is authorised.

- **SEAMLESSNESS**

	Access to all applications by the user takes place seamlessly due to sign-in automation.

This authentication procedure facilitates access to different platforms. It also has other important features in regards to simple management, security, ease of use and seamlessness.
