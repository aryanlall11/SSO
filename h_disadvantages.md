1. Using a single password increases the chances of password vulnerability
2. When SSO fails, access to all related systems is lost
3. Identity spoofing in user external accesses
4. Single point of failure
5. Single high-value target (attracts more attackers)
6. Necessary information disclosure between trusting site and SSO authority
7. Side channel attack against authentication step (theoretically; implementation dependent)
8. Lack of control over your user list
9. Yet another interface to maintain (added complexity)
10. You may never know how secure your system is or if there is a breach
11. Added cost
