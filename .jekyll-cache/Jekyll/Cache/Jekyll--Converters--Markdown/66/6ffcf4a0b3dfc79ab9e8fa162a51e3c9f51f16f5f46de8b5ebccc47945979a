  <li>Extra-strong passwords must be enforced. If an SSO account is cracked, others under the same authentication can also be endangered.</li>
  <li>When SSO is down, access to all connected sites is stopped. This is a big reason to exercise great care in choosing an SSO system. It must be exceptionally reliable and plans should be in place for dealing with breakdowns.</li>
  <li>Whatâ€™s more, when your identity provider goes down, your SSO does too. The providerâ€™s vulnerability to any kind of interruption becomes your vulnerability as well, and it is probably beyond your control. Once again, the choice of vendors is critical.</li>
  <li>If a hacker breaches your identity provider user account, all your linked systems could be open to attack. This can be a classic single point of failure and should be headed off in the planning process. On the plus side, high-quality identity providers have top-notch security.</li>
  <li>SSO can take longer than expected to set up. Each environment is different, so added steps in implementation can crop up. One example is the task linking the identity provider to the service provider.</li>
  <li>SSO is risky for multi-user computers. What happens when one user is logged in and another needs to use the machine?</li>
  <li>Reduced sign-on (RSO) may be needed to accommodate different levels of access. With RSO, additional authentication servers may be required.</li>
  <li>SSO using social networking services can create conflict. This can be the case with workplaces that block social media sites and government connections where censorship is involved.</li>
  <li>Some SSO-linked sites may give their user data to third-party entities. This is an area requiring careful attention.</li>
